Download locally with

(oh, the simplicity).


What, no warnings you say (`-w`)!

Bro this is an exercise in finding errors,
warnings would ruin the [expherience](https://twitter.com/expherience)!

When you are ready to check your answers, do

```
$ ./bin/check p1 14D
```

or when you have more than one error do

```
$ ./bin/check p2 "9001H 1D"
```

You can also just look inside `./answers`. But then that will ruin trying, and seeing the great failure/success messages from `check`.
